\chapter{Literature Review}
The field of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is rapidly evolving, with significant advances in: (i) predictive diagnostic models \cite{optimizing_ai_sepsis_2024}, (ii) Multimodal data integration, and (iii) Explainable AI techniques. 

\section{AI in Healthcare}

\subsection{Surveys}
Here are some survey \& position papers. Rajpurkar et al. \cite{moor2023GMAI} advocate for \textit{generalist medical AI}, i.e. models which are trained on large, unlabelled, diverse datasets with self-supervision, can flexibly ingest different modalities (e.g. imaging, EHR, genomics) and produce expressive outputs (e.g. free-text explanations, spoken recommendations). They argue that such models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data.

\subsection{Healthcare Applications}
\label{sec:healthcare_applications}

\subsubsection{Sepsis}
\label{sec:sepsis}
\textbf{Sepsis}  is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection \cite{singer2016sepsis3}. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals, with an estimated 11 million deaths annually \cite{rudd2020global}. Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in total SOFA score
$\geq 2$ points consequent to the infection, Fig \ref{fig:sofa}. Prior sepsis definitions used two of 4 SIRS criteria, which are not specific to sepsis and can lead to overdiagnosis(patients who has SIRS but not sepsis).

The SOFA score is a clinical score used to track a patient's status during their stay in an ICU. It is used to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure. The SOFA score is based on the following six organ systems: respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological. Each system is assigned a score from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction. The total SOFA score is the sum of the individual scores for each organ system.

\textbf{ML-Driven Sepsis Detection} \\ 
Surveys: Islam et al. \cite{islam2023survey} does a meta-study, showing that a majority of studies used ICU data (Fig \ref{fig:sepsis_datasources}), as well as the MIMIC-III dataset. Most of the studies were carried out using vital signs (73.1\%) and laboratory data (65.4\%).The median number of features was 22. The most common top features were heart rate, temperature, WBC count, systolic BP, age, dystolic BP and respiratory rate.

\subsubsection{Cardiac Arrest}
\label{sec:cardiac_arrest}
\textbf{Cardiac Arrest} is a critical condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It occurs when the heart stops beating effectively, leading to a lack of blood flow to vital organs.  There are two types of cardiac arrest: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). OHCA survival rate to discharge is 10-12\%, while IHCA survival rate is 20-25\% \cite{andersen2019cardiac}. 80\% of presenting rhythms are non-shockable, meaning that defibrillation is not an option, i.e. that early detection is the best fix. The incidence is 9-10 per 1000 admissions \cite{andersen2019cardiac}.

RQ: how do we compress exomic analysis? 
Videos belong in low-dimensional space, so do sequences also?

\section{Time-Series Forecasting}

Given $\mathbf{X}$, a vector of time-series data, and a binary labelling function $f(\mathbf{X}, t)$ which labels the current state as 0/1, our task is to given $\mathbf{X}[i]$, predict $f(\mathbf{X}, j)$ for some $j > i$.

Approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Encode X[0...i] as text, ask an LLM
    \item Encode X[0...i] as text, fine-tune an LLM classification head
    \item Neurosymbolic: Somehow encode X[0...i], get distribution of $f(\hat{X}_{i+1}), f(\hat{X}_{i+2})...f(\hat{X}_{j})$, train a model with binary cross-entropy loss
    \item Neurosymbolic with Pretraining: Somehow encode X[0...i], First, pretrain a model M to do next-event prediction, i.e. given $\mathbf{X}[i]$, predict $\mathbf{X}_{i+1}, \mathbf{X}_{i+2}, ..., \mathbf{X}_{j}$, then fine-tune M using the neurosymbolic approach above.
\end{enumerate}
